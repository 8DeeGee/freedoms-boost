# 🚀 Freedom's Boost

*Freedom’s Boost* is a small Godot 4 project created as part of the [GameDev.TV "Project Boost"](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-godot-3d) Udemy course.  
This version adds a satirical, democratic twist inspired by the explosive universe of **Helldivers 2**.

## 🎮 What Is This?

You control a low poly Super Destroyer™, running a Super Earth™ approved training course on intergalactic navigation, to spread managed democracy one landing pad at a time. Maneuver your way through physics-based levels using thrust, rotate, and boost controls. Just be careful — red walls don’t vote, but they do explode.
